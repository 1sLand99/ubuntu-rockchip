## Recommended Hardware

A Linux host with the following configuration is recommended to set up the build environment. Adequate processing power and disk space is ideal as the build process can be several gigabytes and take a lot of time.

* Intel Core i7 CPU (>= 8 cores)
* Strong internet connection
* 30 GB free disk space
* 16 GB RAM

## Requirements

Please install the below packages on your host machine:

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu bison \
qemu-user-static qemu-system-arm qemu-efi u-boot-tools binfmt-support \
debootstrap flex libssl-dev bc rsync kmod cpio xz-utils fakeroot parted \
udev dosfstools uuid-runtime grub-pc git-lfs
```

## Building

To checkout the source and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-orange-pi5.git
cd ubuntu-orange-pi5
sudo ./build.sh focal
```

## Login

There are two predefined users on the system: `ubuntu` and `root`. The password for each is `root`. 

```
Ubuntu 20.04.5 TLS orange-pi tty1

orange-pi login: root
Password: root
```

## Flash Removable Media

To flash the Ubuntu preinstalled image to removable media:

```
xz -dc images/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-desktop-arm64-orange-pi5.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4k
```

> This assumes that the removable media is added as /dev/sdX and all itâ€™s partitions are unmounted.

## Known Limitations and Bugs

1. A number of packages are installed and held to enable hardware acceleration. So please don't remove them and re-install with apt-get.

2. There is a slight mouse cursor glitch in the Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 releases.

3. Dragging GPU-accelerated windows around in the Ubuntu 22.04 release is slow and laggy.

4. Kernel warnings plague dmesg in the Ubuntu 22.04 release.

5. Booting from an NVMe drive is not yet supported.
